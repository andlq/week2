    Welcome to my site!

    <!-- image of a duck -->

    I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
    internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
    Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...

    HTML is cool
    CSS is cooler
    JS is the best

    What do you need to create a website?

    Not much!
    A computer (always a good start)
    A text editor (I am using atom)
    A web browser (I am using chrome)
    Some HTML, CSS and JS files

    Follow my progress on github
